Why has no-one forked the internet?

It's a huge distribution system, it's effectively free and it already exists. But, it's broken in many fundamental ways and, more alarmingly, it's boring now.

Of course, you can't go back, you can never go back, so this isn't about rebuilding blogs and rss and an internet without adverts, but this a question of why we're all still here. Why hasn't anyone tried to make a new version of the internet?

I don't want to follow and interact with brands, and I don't want to read another listicle, and I don't want to receive all my news in realtime. Those are easy targets, and popular complaints to make, but I think the disenchantment goes deeper than that. The internet is not broken, it is still an amazing creation, but, fundamentally, we're going in the wrong direction...

So, how would a rebooted, forked, new version of the internet work? Simple, exactly the same. But a new version of the web, where we read, discover and connect, could work in many different ways. I would go for the simplest option, text based. I would strip out all of the crap, the bloat and the adverts and the tracking, and focus on huge content. I would slow it down, for sure.

But how does it work, in principle? I don't think you can use the same tools to access a new web. So using internet explorers, chrome, Firefox and Safari shouldn't work. The infrastructure will be the same but we'll need new tools. Although  for now, for this test, I think there's a simpler option - I love my kindle, and I played with the "experimental" web browser and realised it could be the ideal way to test a new web.

If sites on a new web block internet v1 traffic, they can only be accessible to internet v2 devices, to mimic a separate, revamped environment. Maybe this is how I can test out how a forked internet would work - focus on the constraints and make it only work on kindles, and make it slow, black and white, etc...
